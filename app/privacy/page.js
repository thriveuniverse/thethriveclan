          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Your data is stored on secure servers provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP), with primary data centers located in the European Union to prioritize EU data residency. Backups or processing may occur in other compliant regions (e.g., the US) under appropriate safeguards. We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures, including encryption for emails and logs, access controls, and regular security audits, to protect against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no online transmission is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

            <li>Account data (e.g., email) and activity logs are kept for the duration of your active account and up to 3 years after your last interaction (e.g., login or purchase) to support potential support needs and analytics.</li>
            <li>Transaction-related data (e.g., purchase confirmations) is retained for up to 7 years to meet tax, accounting, and regulatory obligations in the EU and US.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            After these periods, data is securely deleted or anonymized. You can request earlier deletion at any time, subject to legal retention needs.
